# Data Structures and Algorithms Library

This repository contains examples of various data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. 
The code is organized into different modules based on the data structures and algorithms covered.

## Graph Algorithms

The `myLib.build.lib.graphalgo` package contains implementations of graph algorithms.

- `BFS.py`: Contains the `BFS` class that performs breadth-first search traversal on a graph.
- `DFS.py`: Contains the `DFS` class that performs depth-first search traversal on a graph.
- `Graph.py`: Contains the `Graph` class that represents a graph data structure.

## Heap Data Structure

The `myLib.build.lib.Datastructures.heap` package contains implementations of the heap data structure.

- `Heap.py`: Contains the `Heap` class, which serves as the base class for both the `MinH` (minimum heap) and `MaxH` (maximum heap) classes.
- `MinH.py`: Contains the `MinH` class, which represents a minimum heap.
- `MaxH.py`: Contains the `MaxH` class, which represents a maximum heap.

## Linked List Data Structures

The `myLib.build.lib.Datastructures.linear` package contains implementations of linked list data structures.

- `SLL.py`: Contains the `SLL` class, which represents a singly linked list.
- `CSLL.py`: Contains the `CSLL` class, which represents a circular singly linked list.
- `DLL.py`: Contains the `DLL` class, which represents a doubly linked list.
- `CDLL.py`: Contains the `CDLL` class, which represents a circular doubly linked list.
- `QueueLL.py`: Contains the `QueueLL` class, which represents a queue implemented using a singly linked list.
- `StackLL.py`: Contains the `StackLL` class, which represents a stack implemented using a singly linked list.

## Tree Data Structures

The `myLib.build.lib.Datastructures.trees` package contains implementations of tree data structures.

- `BST.py`: Contains the `BST` class, which represents a binary search tree.
- `AVL.py`: Contains the `AVL` class, which represents an AVL (Adelson-Velskii and Landis) tree.

## Node Classes

The `myLib.build.lib.Datastructures.nodes` package contains classes representing nodes used in various data structures.

- `SNode.py`: Contains the `SNode` class, which represents a node in a singly linked list or circular singly linked list.
- `DNode.py`: Contains the `DNode` class, which represents a node in a doubly linked list or circular doubly linked list.
- `TNode.py`: Contains the `TNode` class, which represents a node in a binary search tree or AVL tree.

## Testing

The `myLib.build.lib.Datastructures.test` package contains various test for the implementations of all the various classes.

-Each test file is labeled with the corresponding name of each class.
